Reference white wall. Luminosity variation because of increasing
distance from camera flash. Cost us 60kINR to do the foundation primer
and white paint in Jan 2008. Top grade paint, supposed to last ~7
years.

Wall of kitchen after repairs. Pigmented water from the outside fresh
plaster seeps in, cracks open our plaster of Paris, detaches it from
the wall, and emerges in ugly patterns.

<td valign="top">
Similar graffiti on bedroom wall. Massive peeling and detachment of
plaster of Paris, with cotton-like efflorescence, seepage, and
discoloration.

This one is not due to the current repairs, but shows the effect of
replacing perfectly fine floor tiles with Marbonite in the summer of
2007, together with concealed plumbing. The bathroom above has a
leakage in the concealed pipe. Here that water is seeping into our
bedroom...

... and here it is seeping into the adjoining bathroom. It can't get
past the tiled walls, so it finds the easiest way out: through the
ceiling.

Balcony bird nets have been torn in multiple places by the laborers
securing the scaffolding without any care for our property.
