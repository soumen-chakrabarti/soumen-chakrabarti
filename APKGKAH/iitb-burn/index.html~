<h1>Fiddling (with a camera) as the countryside burns</h1>

<p>On a clear Spring day (2005/02/17 to be exact) this is how the view
looks from my apartment. Ah, the clear blue sky and the limpid glow of
fresh green leaves!</p>

<h2>The fire</h2>

<p>Vegetation explodes during monsoon at IIT.  After every monsoon, a
Festival of Burning begins, and continues until the next monsoon makes
it impossible to light a match.  There are fairly well-organized fires
every week or so on the hillside.  The local people seem to enjoy
filling their lungs with smoke and soot; in 3--4 years I have not
heard a single person (including IIT professors) express concern over
the air quality.</p>

<p>Some fires are built at night by campus folks and watchmen to face
the merciless onslaught of winter nights, which can be as brutally
cold as 10 degrees centrigrade (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in
Mumbai. Perhaps I am being a reactionary and they are too poor to
afford sweaters.</p>


<h2>Holy smoke!</h2>

<p>The smoke drifts south-east across Powai Lake, probably killing all
kinds of insects and driving many little creatures from trees and
bushes, and then reaches IIT.  The air becomes thick with suspended
particulate matter, and I must close all windows to breathe
normally.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are additional burn-fests held inside IIT.  In the
pictures above you see the familiar Vihar plume as well as a more
diffused smokescreen in the foreground, most likely from a fire
burning around the SAMEER area.  You can even watch
a <a href="MOV00450.MPG">short video</a>.</p>

<p>(Why all those photos above? The popups give you the dates.
Eventually I picked up other hobbies.)</p>



<h2>The charred victims</h2>

<p>What remains at the end of a burning orgy?  Vast expanses of
charred moon-like surface, trees devastated worse than the Godhra
victims, tracts of wasteland, dramatic loss in ground cover and
increase in airborne suspended particulate matter.</p>

<img height="240" src="2004-12-08_453.jpg" />
</div>



<h2>Looking for explanations</h2>

<p>It is not easy to figure out why all this burning is needed, or to
locate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krikkit#Krikkit">the
citizens of Krikkit</a> responsible for this burning orgy. Indian
society is famous for hiding actors and motives behind layers of
obfuscation and bureaucracy, and who am I to ask and probe anyway?
However, over the years, I have obtained a few signals amid the
noise.</p>

<p>As late as 2005, panthers formed a great excuse for decimating 
trees and shrubs. Here is an excerpt from a notice from our 
security chief (who, as it turns out, went to jail):
<div class="excerpt">
  Clearing of bushes: Wild bushes in and around departments, 
  residential areas and roadsides are being cleared on priority 
  basis.
</div>
right after some panther sightings on campus.
</p>

<p>Apart from the fires that are meant to get rid of
&quot;over-vegetation&quot; to keep the campus clean, green,
unfriendly to panthers and friendly to doctors that treat respiratory
diseases, fires are set off on the hills to the north of IIT, by
&quot;local people&quot;.  Apparently the fire destroys weeds, the ash
is good fertilizer, and the fresh grass is great for their cattle.
This does not stand well to reason, because I have seen giant fires on
slopes too steep for cattle.</p>

<p>It would be fashionable to finish with &quot;posterity will never
forgive the people responsible for this mayhem&quot; but the reality
is, posterity will be <a href="http://www.dnrec.state.de.us/DNREC2000/Divisions/AWM/OpenBurning.htm">too busy wheezing</a> and <a href="http://tillandsias.home.att.net/Leafburning.htm">gasping for breath</a> to
worry about assigning blame.</p>



<h2>Years pass...</h2>

<p>But the burning continues.  Updated pictures from early 2007.</p>

<img src="DSC01556.JPG" title="Passive smoking in the dusk"/>

<p>The strategy has now shifted to burning at random times around the
clock, particularly at dusk when the smoke will not be easily visible.</p>

<img src="DSC01805.JPG" title="Hills aflame at dusk"/>

<p>Yet more pictures.  The Deputy Director Professor Vasi, Dean
Planning Professor Malik and Associated Dean Planning Professor
Krishna Rao have been sent these photos again and again.
They were informed in August 2007, and there has been no action
until at least November 2008.</p>

<p>Another year passes, more smoke is sent up our collective ass.
Economizing on comments now.</p>

<p>Over the years I realized that, in a country where a <a
href="http://newshopper.sulekha.com/newsitem/2008/11/boy-dies-after-being-pushed-from-rtc-bus.htm">kid
may be pushed out of a moving bus to die because he did not carry
exact change (although he did carry cash!)</a>, whining about
getting my lungs poisoned is impolite.</p>
