<h1>Our factories devour cars and excrete iron ore!</h1>

<p>&quot;Industrial output goes negative in Oct after 15 years&quot;
shouts DNA (Daily News and Analysis).  &quot;India's
industrial production fell into negative territory for the first time
in 15 years&quot; it repeats.<p>

<p>Only after you pick up your chair (is it back to being a tree?) and
wipe the coffee stains from your shirt (hopefully, it hasn't turned
into cotton pods yet), you see the chart caption, and the sentence at
the bottom of the image: &quot;This is the first time industrial
<strong>growth</strong> has turned negative since April
1993&quot;.</p>

<p>There is also a priceless quotation from a Dharmakirti Joshi of
Crisil, just across the fold: &quot;I am surprised because production
of consumer non-durables such as toothpaste, soap, etc. has fallen
... people don't stop using [them] so quickly.&quot;</p>
