Is it illegal or corrupt to pay ransom to a kidnapper to rescue a child? Are you entitled to your child? Are you entitled to the child's birth certificate if a bribe is demanded? Is the child entitled to unadulterated food? Decent school and college education? Is your child entitled to a surgeon's or pilot's diploma even if s/he is not good at that job? Is your child entitled to a passport? Is your child entitled to a 800 square foot apartment in Kalyan? How about Cuff Parade? Is your child entitled to inherit hundreds of billions of dollars from your spoils through Bofors or 2G? On the opposite extreme, how many people do we need to cram into this soiled subcontinent before essentially NO entitlement can be entertained? Are you entitled to clean air and water? Chances are, you are not, already. It is deeply disappointing to see some of the public figures as well as most readers here go into conniptions about corruption without understanding that the root cause is the lack of definition of "reasonable entitlement", in the face of rapidly dwindling per-capita resource base. Once that is set, our moral compass will find its way automatically. If that is not set through public discourse, society will continue to disintegrate.
