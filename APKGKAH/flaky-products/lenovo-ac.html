<h1>RAM is cheaper than programmers</h1>

<p>Lenovo thinks nothing of writing a network switching utility for a
laptop with a <em>service</em> (&quot;demon&quot; for the
winblows-challenged) that hogs over 29 megabytes, even if you are not
changing network settings! Just the systray icon costs you 10MB!</p>

<p>I cannot recall if I sent in a complaint or not, but I just got this
reply from Lenovo, saying &quot;take it or leave it&quot; as only
corporations can.</p>
