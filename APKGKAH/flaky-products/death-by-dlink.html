<h1>Buy DLink, die within three years</h1>

<p>The obligatory photos will come soon, but here's the gist: the
warranty policy enclosed with a DLink ethernet card I bought recently
claims &quot;*lifetime&quot; warranty (note the asterisk!).</p>

<p>Intrigued, I chased down the asterisk and found this (we will
ignore the pathetic quality of language here):</p>

<div class="excerpt">
*D-Link's Lifetime warranty is a 3 years warranty against
manufacturing defects.  The Warranty is limited to 3 years due
to limited availability of components after 3 years. [...] Incase
of any disputes or warranty terms the decision of D-Link
authorized staff will be final and binding on the customer.</div>

<p>In other words, if your lifetime stretches beyond three years after
buying a DLink product with &quot;*Lifetime&quot; warranty, DLink will
authorize its staff to terminate you.  If the warranty document is
written in English, as it appears to be, that is the only possible
interpretation.</p>

<p>People who willfully subvert language should be put away like
rabid curs.</p>

<p>I hear a similar but much bigger mischief is afoot with mobile
service companies promising &quot;lifetime&quot; accounts; you need
to read the fine print to get the SIM-recharging details.</p>
