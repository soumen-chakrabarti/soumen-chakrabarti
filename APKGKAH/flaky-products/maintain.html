      The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble
      activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it
      is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor
      good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories
      will hold water<br />
      ---<em>John W. Gardner</em>.

<h1>Acquisition requires money; maintenance requires culture</h1>

<p>The post-liberal middle-class Indian aping various Western ways of
life without any depth of understanding of our surrounding support
system leads to an endless stream of stupid behavior here around IIT
by people who should know better.</p>

<div><img src="DSC01743.JPG" align="left" style="margin: 10px" />
<p>No <s>self-</s> money-respecting Indian architect today can imagine
bathrooms with exposed plumbing.  However, unlike developed nations
that have a large underbelly of technical vocational schools and
certified plumbers, Indian construction quality is the pits.  Here you
see a urinal that originally had a concealed exit pipe.</p>
<p>The concealed pipe got blocked. In the Indian construction
industry, the only labor that is semi-skilled get whisked away to
Dubai or by new construction jobs that pay better than the repair
industry.  In the repair sector, it's nearly impossible to find anyone
who can fog a mirror. So you basically cannot find anyone who will
debug the blocked concealed plumbing, ripping out and replacing the
tiles if needed.</p>
<p><a href="../iitb-road/">Elsewhere</a> I have commented on Indians
inventing the phrase &quot;cutting corners&quot;. So what do we do
here? Abandon the concealed plumbing and connect an external PVC pipe
to the drain. (Actually, in the initial months, until a C3-grade
plumber was found, a bucket was placed below the urinal and drained
occasionally. Yuck.)</p>
<p>The PVC pipe has displaced the drain cover as you can see. The top
opening to the concealed pipe remains open. Smelliness and roaches are
the result, forget the looks. This, by the way, in a five-year-old
building inside IIT.</p>
<p>So we spend for the concealed plumbing, then we spend for the
external plumbing and we spend for the ad-hoc ugliness and lack of
function. And still we have morons like Tom "give war a chance"
Friedman extolling the efficiency of "flat earth" outsourcing and the
economics of efficiency.</p> </div>

<p>Another example. (Why am I obsessed with bathrooms? Because that's
where people's culture shows through best.) A soap dispenser is first
installed on the wall. Perhaps the cleaning crew has no clew how to
refill it, or perhaps it's a rough patron of the john. In any case,
the dispenser button has been bashed in sideways, and there is no soap
inside.  Instead the dispenser cover is jammed into the soap
tank. (Now you know better than to shake hands with an IITian!)</p>
<p>The eventual solution? Abandon the soap dispenser and use a coke
bottle with a hole punched in the cap and filled with liquid soap! The
cleaning crew is comfortable with refilling coke bottles (eventually
the cap will be lost but who cares) and the john patron can live with
it. I think it's actually a good idea to recycle and reuse all the
polymer poison created by Coke.</p>
<p>But once again, we procured and installed and paid for something we
had no commitment to maintain and keep functional. We first spent for
the dispenser, then many "employees did not wash their hands before
returning to work", and then we did a fix that was consistent with our
level of culture and civilization. But some dispenser dispenser got
rich on the way.</p></div>

<div><p> Update (2013): The computer science building was recently
fitted out with the kind of soap dispenser shown in this following
photo.</p>
<img src="2012-07-06_19.16.16.jpg" />
<p>Not visible in the photo is a small keyhole on top of the lid that
has to be opened with a small plastic key.  Within a week of
installation, the janitors lost the keys.  Unable to recharge the
dispenser, they returned to the time-tested technology of coke bottles
with a hole punched in the cap.</p>
<img src="2012-07-06_19.16.02.png" />
<p>In this photo you can also see the first generation soap dispenser
originally installed when the building was occupied in 2003.  So there
you have it: three soap dispensers for one handwash.  Capitalism is
nothing if not about consumer choice!  (The soap you see in the newest
dispenser ran out in a week and could never be refilled because the
keys were missing.)</p>
