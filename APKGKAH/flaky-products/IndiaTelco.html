<h1>The smartphone and Internet revolutions passed me by</h1>

<p>The mobile Internet and smartphone revolutions are associated with
happy, peppy, easygoing but successful, social, friendly, smiling
people whose lives are a nonstop blast.  You know, like these people.
Connecting, (be)friending, chirping, tweeting, perhaps even working
and making money.  Perhaps multitasking on all of the above, while
also walking down Main Street, checking their stock options, and
having paani puri!</p>

<p>They are privileged global citizens owning smartphones --- marvels
of modern technology that blur the distinctions between phone,
computer and television; in other words, utility, work and
entertainment.  And if they have graduated from smartphones to
tablets, that's a prescription for a whole new level of ecstacy.</p>

<p>Carbon dating on my fossils shows that I belong to the previous
millenium, so I never expected quite this level of ecstacy.  My goals,
in buying a smartphone (Samsung Android 2012 dual SIM) and signing up
for 3G plans of MTNL and Vodafone, were far more modest:
<ul>
<li>Voice calls comparable to my previous Nokia 3230 running Symbian.
You know, you punch the number, the other party hears the ring within
two seconds, and you start conversing in four seconds, without
straining your voice and ears and repeating every sentence five
times.</li>
<li>Receiving one-time passwords from my bank or credit card via SMS
before eBay tears down the session and labels me a deadbeat.</li>
<li>Email and basic near-static Web access.  An HTML page with a
couple images, or a PDF document about 400kB large, should load in
about 10 seconds.  No need for multimedia listening or viewing.  Would
be nice to get Web content a little faster than the first 1200 baud
modem I used in 1993.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Before I took the plunge, I was assured by many that all of the
above, and much more, were theirs and could well be mine, too.</p>
