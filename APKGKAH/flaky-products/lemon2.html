<h1>Get Paid for Creating Cognitive Dissonance</h1>

<p>From the contour, the lemon's axis is vertical.  In that case, how
can the section show radial lines?  I was subconsciously bothered by
the label during several showers before I realized what was wrong.</p>

<p>Imagine, someone in a consumer product design company was paid real
money to design that label.</p>

<p>Other language problems are endemic to India.  The shampoo (right)
promises, reasonably enough, that it &quot;softens and vitalizes
normal hair&quot;.  But the conditioner (left) misses a vital
&quot;to&quot; and can therefore be interpreted as a means to
&quot;dull, lifeless hair&quot;.</p>

<p>Expiry dates on perishables sold in India are written along with
some hilarious English, including &quot;best used before within six
months from the date of manufacture&quot;.</p>
