We run two SUVTP30KH units. Apart from the serial port, these have a "service port" which has one critical user setting that really belongs to the serial port (or Web configurator): whether the UPS obeys commands to power down the load. By default, this policy is set to "never" instead of "secure" or "PC-link" which are what most customers need. What is worse, the user manual did not include any instruction on how to connect to the service port and change this setting. What is worst, one unit was under first year warranty; so I opened a case with APC India early April, and this did not get resolved even in late July! Meanwhile, I obtained the secret commands for the service port on an Internet forum, and configured the UPSs myself before APC could respond with a solution.
