<h1>Why share a planet with these morons?</h1>


<h2>Server busy!Plz try after some time</h2>

<p>The sordid story of Indian Airlines, Air Indian, and Air India is
well-known.  Their slop is not limited to leaking toilets and engines
on fire.  It shows even in their Web site.</p>

<img src="AirIndian.gif" alt="Server busy!Plz try after some time"/>

<p>Leaving aside the shame of the number one national carrier's Web
site being too overloaded to serve requests, how do we count the
number of offsenses on the above page?</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does it start with &quot;--&gt;&quot?  Broken HTML?</li>
<li>"scripts" in the URL looks unprofessional.</li>
<li>The images are not sized or resized properly.</li>
<li>And to cap it all, <em>Server busy!Plz try after some time</em> 
is just so crass!  No space after "!".  Please abbreviated to "Plz" 
as if the programmer is sending an SMS to a yaar.  No period at the
end.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Unreliance</h2>

<p>Reliance is (among other sins) a major mobile service provider in
India.  While trying to pay their bill online recently, my Web browser
was unhappy thusly:</p>

<img src="UnReliance1.png" alt="Unreliance" />

<p>Imagine, a company having Reliance's size and reach cannot command
enough <em>care</em> to make sure a site called
<tt>rbill.relianceinfo.com</tt> does not offer a stale certificate
made in the name of <tt>rbill.rcom.co.in</tt>.  Money does not buy any
care in India today.</p>


<h2>Programming lessons from SBI</h2>

<p>Most people I know don't need Javascript or ASPX or Tomcat lessons
when they do online business.  Yet, more often than not, State Bank of
India's Web sites greet you with screens like these:</p>

<img src="SBIUnbilled.png" alt="Go away!" />

<p>"Unexpected Error"---who is that? And "has been occured [sic.]?"
Why is Security capitalized?  "Suggest you to"?  If you think I am
picking nits, consider that hundreds of millions of people turn in
their hard-earned cash to SBI for safekeeping.</p>

<img src="SBIDeported.png" alt="Go away!" />

<p>"Error 500: Define tag cannot set a null value" --- wow. What next,
you call in and dictate to them the bug fix?  And this one is even
better: "java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" --- now you know
who keeps track of your cash.</p>

<img src="SBIException.png" alt="Whoops!" />

<p>Observe that the bug resulted in each ad blurb being presented
twice!  So how do you know the same is not happening with service
charges?</p>


<h2>Raise the bar for idiocy</h2>

<p>Seen on an emergency exit in Apollo Hospital, Kolkata.</p>

<img src="PushBarToOpen.jpg" alt="Push bar for idiocy" />

<p>The hands might be pushing the bar on the door.  Or they may be
lifting weights.  Unclear.  But the worst part is the Bangla legend.
It is not Bangla for "Push Bar to Open", it is a
<em>transliteration</em>.  Imagine a hapless victim trapped inside
Apollo during a fire or earthquake, reading the "Bangla" and trying to
figure out what it means.</p>
