<h1>We had to restrain the patient</h1>

<div>
<img src="SillyDNA.png" align="left" width="196" />
The "young adult" or "YA" section of DNA brought out this gem: a
collection of "The World's Sillest Laws".  Many are worthy claimants
to that title, but watch out what is snuck in there:
<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<ul style="padding-left: 3em; margin-left: 3em;">
<li>In Singapore, you could get arrested for feeding birds, spitting
or not flushing public toilets.</li>
<li>In Switzerland, washing a car or mowing the lawn on Sunday is
illegal as it disturbs people.  (The next sentence is clearly libel,
but the Swiss obviously cannot care less.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
Also observe the obvious framing of the discourse with the image of a
"stern headmaster" type court judge wielding a gavel.  The message
being, "ignore this dork and laugh at him".</p>

<p>Being brought up in the excellent Indian tradition of non-silliness,
it is no wonder that IIT students park their vehicles <em>right on top
of</em> "no parking" signs on the ground.</p>

<p>(Ok, so the sign is a little faded, but it's quite readable, wasn't
always this way, and hey, this is India.  You fill in unreadable
tenth-generation xeroxed forms to get a train ticket or a job.)</p>

<p>This singular inability or refusal of the so-called literate
population to read, understand and follow instruction makes one wonder
how many years of India are left.</p>

<p>Oh well, kids will be kids, and they were perhaps in a rush to get
to lectures.  An encounter with someone a little older than a boy in
mid-2010 was an eye opener.  It is a testament to the times that the
following happened around July 2010 and I have not had time to write
this up until early 2011.  It means the amount of bad behavior is
rapidly overruning people's ability to notice and chronicle it, leave
alone deal with it.</p>

<p>Between P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Saxena Lecture Theater and KReSIT building
lie a barely 15-feet wide stretch of road that is eternally congested
by construction material, pedestrians, and badly-parked vehicles.  On
this stretch, at most four car lengths apart are two no-parking signs.
<em>Faculty/staff cars</em> with clear IIT stickers are
parked <em>every day</em>, not near, but <em>right next to</em> the
no-parking signs (clear and in Hindi as well).  In the left photo you
can see a high-tension electrical junction box blocked off from
possibly critical street access by the cyan car.  In the right photo
you can see a walkway with signs blocked off from pedestrians by the
blue car, who must now bypass it by walking on grass.</p>

<p>It bothers me no end what kind of message about civic discipline
this imparts to the "cream of the nation" we supposedly teach over
here.</p>

<p>So one morning I was cycling down this road when I saw yet another
faculty member (who probably wrote a PhD thesis in English) draw up to
the no-parking sign like the cyan car, turn off the engine, and get
out from the car.  The ensuing conversation is reproduced with
considerable accuracy below (AH=the unknown professor).  It is quite
entertaining.</p>

<div style="border-left: 5pt solid gray; padding-left: 10pt; ">

<p>SC: Morning, excuse me, when they say "no parking", would you know
how many nanometers away you can legally park?</p>

<p>AH: (Appearing to think deeply) Hmm, yes.  You know, that's a great
question.  I have no idea how many nanometers or Angstroms away one is
allowed to park.  Do you?</p>

<p>SC: No, but that's because I do not drive a car.  If I did, I would
know, and follow the rules.  You are driving a car.  Do you know the
rule?</p>

<p>AH: Many signs are ambiguous.  You have seen speed limit signs they
have put up around campus.  They just say "30".  They do not say if it
is km per hour or miles per second.</p>

<p>SC: Street signs are usually too small to print the constitution in
large font.  Citizens are supposed to know the law. At least,
prevalent units of measure in use.  Especially if they claim to be
scientists and engineers.</p>

<p>AH: Why don't you go ask IIT security how close to a no-parking
sign one can park and satisfy your curiosity?</p>

<p>SC: Isn't that your job, given you are the one parked here?</p>

<p>AH: (Trying to bail out with a diversion.) But how does this
concern you?  Are you a professor?  Don't you have your research to
do, classes to teach?</p>

<p>SC: I <em>am</em> a professor, so naturally bad public behavior on
part of a colleague inside campus concerns me.</p>

<p>AH: You look very upset.  Did you sleep well?  Have you had a good
breakfast?</p>

<p>SC: Wait, next you will ask me if I brushed my teeth this morning
and changed my underwear.  All that is not relevant to your parking
habits.  I am Soumen Chakrabarti from Computer Science.  Who are you?
Do you have an ID?</p>

<p>AH: I am (voice dwindles to a mumble so I cannot hear his name,
honest) from Physics.  If you want my ID you have to come with a
security officer.  (Walks off.)</p>
</div>

<p>So there you have it.  A professor of a supposedly premier
technical college, parking illegally and showing a big middle finger
to a colleague for pointing it out.  Of course, the more sophisticated
and jaded among you are going, "Which planet is this guy from?  This
is a country
where <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-boy-dies-after-being-pushed-out-of-running-bus-1202674" href1="http://newshopper.sulekha.com/newsitem/2008/11/boy-dies-after-being-pushed-from-rtc-bus.htm">a
13-year-old boy can die because a bus conductor pushed him out for not
carrying exact change</a>
and <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/article1126095.ece">a
government official can be burnt to death for accosting the kerosene
mafia</a>".  But in a way this just reinforces what I am trying to
say: There is no hope because many a member of even the educated urban 
middle class
Indian is as much a vicious little prick as a member of the kerosene
mafia.  They would do anything in myopic self-interest and complete
disregard for others, if only they could do so with impunity.
Compared to this field of rotting moral cadavers, the often-trotted
"moral vacuum" would be heaven.</p>

<p>It is also a bounding argument.  If some of the most educated, most
privileged sections of Indian society behave like this, then, on an
average, reform depends on people even less prepared for civilization.
(I already hear the few surviving closet commies claim that the less
privileged is often more honest than the petty bourgeoisie IIT prof.
To them I can only say: keep dreaming.)</p>

<p>Which brings me to the title of this sordid prose.  Chemical
imbalances in the brain, caused by serious illness or drugs, can make
patients hallucinate and lose spatial cognition and coordination.
They can jump off balconies, cut themselves with knives, or break
their necks tumbling down staircases.  If placed under medical
supervision, they are usually restrained (tied up) for their own
safety and recovery by the kindly and well-meaning physician, even
though it looks like they have lost their last vestige of human
dignity.  But there is no alternative: not only is the patient
incapable of caring for himself, <em>he is an active threat to his own
survival</em>.</p>

<p>Who will do this for India?</p>

<p>The analogy used above is already imperfect: doctors are hardly a
trusted and respected lot in India, and cannot often be relied upon to
act in the patient's best interest.  When it comes to the sphere of
governance in the best interest of the governed, of course all bets
are off.  India has been quite the petri dish of social order the last
millenium: emperors, petty kings, zamindars, colonial rulers, rule by
brown sahibs, rule by sleek thieves, and finally rule by the
mob---nothing seems to be working; we seem to be ungovernable.  There
is an impossibility theorem (regarding India's chances of lurching out
of the steadily deepening hole some day) lurking around
somewhere...</p>
