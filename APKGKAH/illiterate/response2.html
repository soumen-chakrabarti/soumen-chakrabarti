<br>
Respected Sir<br>
Through the columns&nbsp; referred by you&nbsp; &quot; <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/media/images/pix-apkgkah/illiterate/">http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/media/images/pix-apkgkah/illiterate/</a><br>
&quot;&nbsp; <b><i>i am highly impressed</i></b>&nbsp; by the&nbsp; <b>eligent examples</b> for the request for summer projects from various students across the country .&nbsp;  <br>
But i <b>beg </b>(with much applause &amp; with <u><b>out any wrong&nbsp; intention</b></u> ) ,&nbsp; would like to express my views in this regard( supporting above URL&nbsp; ).<br>
<br>
<br>
a) This is not the students faults but the fault in the&nbsp; education system . As&nbsp; primarily <b>IIT&#39;s</b> are considered to be the <b>STANFORD</b> of the india (<b> metaphor</b> ) and students from the <b>poor</b> ( in quality , relatively ) colleges think they can improve them self under the guidance of RESPECTED&nbsp; and MOTIVATING <b>professor&#39;s</b> . <br>

<br>
<br>
b)&nbsp; As ( under the IIT act 1961 referred on site ) IIT are the
institutes of National Importance they think they have something&nbsp; quite
precious technical center so that they can compete and make this
statement false <br>
--<font class="sb13"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&#39;<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">India does not
produce enough good computer engineers and those it does are good at
theory but not very well equipped to handle the practical aspects</span>.&#39;<br>--</font><font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" face="Arial" size="2">Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Craig Mundie</font></b></font>. <br>

( <a href="http://in.rediff.com/money/2005/nov/30bspec.htm">http://in.rediff.com/money/2005/nov/30bspec.htm</a> )<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
c) &quot; The IITs were created to train <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" title="Science">scientists</a> and engineers, with the aim of developing a skilled workforce to support the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India" title="Economy of India">economic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India" title="Culture of India">social</a> development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> after independence in 1947 &quot; (wiki - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology</a>)<br>

<br>
So it may be possible that STUDENT refer this statement <b>hoping to help INDIA</b> by improving there Technical Knowledge( <b>ironical </b>).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
d) IIT&#39;s have become a <b>BRAND</b> ( <b><i>for brain- drain also</i></b> ) . so student think at least doing a summer project for <b>just two month</b>&nbsp; may&nbsp; provide a <b>OPTION to brain drain</b> .<br>
<br>
<br>
e) Some students ( though may be very less in %,&nbsp; like me who were cleared IIT-JEE exam , securing ranks above 2800 and <b>who preferred other colleges</b> ) think it can be&nbsp; a platform to enrich there <b>RESEARCH CREATIVITY</b> in a short&nbsp; period&nbsp; (2 months )&nbsp; and to make an better way to do MS-PHD in <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">University of California,Stanford  </a><br>

like universities (as usual &nbsp; IIT&nbsp; students do )<br>
