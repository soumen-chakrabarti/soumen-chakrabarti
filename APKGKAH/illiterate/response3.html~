<h1>Your webpage is the most depressing one ever !!!</h1>

<p>Nice demo here of why India's future is nonexistent:
The writer is as illiterate as his spamming brethren, has
a major righteous indignation syndrome to match, 
and makes the following assumptions, among others,
without any basis:
<ul>
<li>A &quot;literate&quot; person does not blame people
or the system.</li>
<li>I returned to India and joined IIT 
because I am patriotic.</li>
<li>IIT professors are required to be patriotic, while
students have all the moral and natural rights to
run off to the Promised Land at the earliest opportunity.
<li>Working hard for one's country is not enough,
one has to be <em>respectful</em>.</li>
<li>Patriots don't mock idiots just because they share
a citizenship.  (Not surprising; this notion of patriotism
is making inroads into India as surely as brown and green
eyes and dyed hair and pizza and coke.)</li>
<li>IIT does not give me enough work, seeing I have time
to mock Indians.</li>
<li>Random byproducts
of the Indian middle-class's dopamine and serotonin fixes 
have moral claim to my time and mailbox, even if they are not
enrolled at IIT.</li>
<li>Sending flame spam mail to
people already annoyed with spam
demonstrates bravery.</li>
<li>Flame is flame.  No need for grammatical sentences
or coherence there.</li>
</ul>
I agree with one item in this email: I most certainly
am a loser, given I share not only a planet and species
but even citizenship with such people.
Those the gods would destroy, they first make stupid.
Enjoy the mail...

<p>Hello Soumen,</p>

<p>I write this with deep respect for your accomplishments and also
with utter disrespect and sorry for your lack of understanding of the
state of your own country and your fellow citizens.</p>

<p>I felt really depressed to read your website and your comments on
the student mails you received.</p>

<p>It was really shocking to see that a learned("Literate") person as
you are, have resorted to blaming people and the system around you
rather than understanding the reasons behind.</p>

<p>You clearly know the poor state of the faculty and facilities at
the various colleges of india. Being an IITian myself, i can say that
IIT`s also are no way great compared to the US universities here. But
still, the students never stopped dreaming about making big on the
world platform. Their intentions to learn more and accomplish
something , is very laudable inspite of the dire conditions they are
coming from. Being a learned person, you should be able to help these
people as much as you can instead of shunning down their dreams ,
deleting the mails and mocking them by putting it on your
website. Instead of that, why dont you give them a research problem ,
and guide them with some open-source resources, and ask them to figure
out the problem from their college itself. Iam sure the students would
love that proposal. All that they need is sheer guidance, support and
motivation rather than your mockery.</p>

<p>Whenever i hear to any indian professor in US, mocking at the
indian political and educational system, i feel sorry for their
stupidity and lack of commonsense. I feel sorry for our country to
have spent so much tax-payers money on them, and get back in return
mockery and disrespect. But when i learnt about yourself,
Prof.Sudarshan and Prof.Sarawagi of your own group, i felt happy that
atleast some people are repaying back to the country in a respectable
manner. But when i went through your webpage, i found that you are no
way the mahatma i thought. Instead you people are mocking at our
country on its face by being in its own land. Just imagine Manmohan
singh mocking at indians and the system !!!!</p>

<p>No wonder the indian politicians have a complete lack of
understanding about the state of educational system. They are
demeaning even the IIT`s by the reservation system.  But atleast, the
professors at IIT`s are not expected to behave so "Illiterate". You
say that indians are illiterate, but i say YOU are more illiterate
compared to them. Infact you professors are responsible for their
ILLITERACY !!!</p>

<p>Now if you have the guts and enough logic in your mind, try to put
this mail on your website. Atleast once , try to show that
impartiality and logic follows all your literacy.</p>

<p>Iam sure you would not even care to do this, but anyways my purpose
was to just vent out my anger and feel happy that i was able bravely
say that YOU ARE STUPID AND A LOSER !!!</p>

<p>I pray to god that , instead of literacy ,knowledge, and degrees,
people in india be bestowed with understanding of the reason behind
the flaws in the system and be able to sort out a solution for it.</p>

<p>Try to delete that webpage, if any small amount of patriotism is
still left in you.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this mail,<br/>
An Indian.</p>
