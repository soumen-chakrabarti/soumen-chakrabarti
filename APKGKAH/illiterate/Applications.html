<h1>Can't read but will apply</h1>

<p>Every few days I have to delete an email that looks like one of
these:</p>

<div class="excerpt">

this opportunity based on my resume given below.I Promise that all the

<div class="excerpt">

</div>

<div class="excerpt">
My university will be offering me a break from May to June. I'd be highly
obliged if you give me a chance to take part in a training/project
program in your highly esteemed institute. I understand that the projects
are conducted according to the availability of teachers. In case if some

<div class="excerpt">
I am a student of 3rd year, pursuing my B-Tech from Computer Science and
Engineering Department, XXXX. I am interested in doing a summer project
under you in the field of Databases during summer '06.
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
I desire to pursue my Summer Internship under your Intellectual and
genuine guidance.
</div>

<p>And then there are those who would exploit &quot;six degrees of
separation&quot;:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
Dear Sir, Myself is RRR TTTT working in OOOO as scientific officer and
also an IITB alumini.my younger brother is persuing B Tech in CSE from
LLLL(XX).He has great willingness to work a small project under
your guidence.  i am sending a brief introduction about him which is
as follows.
</div>

<p>This one takes the cake:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
I am FFF LLL, a B Tech Computer Sc student from MMM SSS Institute of 
Technology under WWWUUUTTT.  Sir I have keen desire to get my doctoral
from a US University on Distributed computing or Wireless Technologies,
so I am going to sit for GRE. For the purpose, without preambling, as
you know I must secure some good recommendation. So it is my earnest
appeal to you that please show me the way and elevate my dream.
Waiting for your reply and oblige.
</div>

<p>And here is an irresistible offer:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
My name is JJJJ R RRRR.  I am an International Rifle Shooter of India 
and I was a member of an INDIAN AIR RIFLE SHOOTING TEAM FOR YEAR 2006.
I am a presently studding in a 7th semester of B.E. Information 
Technology at LLLL DDDD Engineering College, AAAA, GGGG. Sir, I want 
to do my 8th semester project work under your supervision. I am sending
my Resume with this. I am sure that you would kindly cooperate 
and oblige.
</div>
<p>How could I possibly refuse from the wrong end of a Remington?</p>

<p>Then there is in-your-face dishonesty:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
I have gone through your research activities given on your homepage.
I am looking for a challenging opportunity for summer internship
for the period of May-July 2007.
</div>

<p>When I pointed out that anyone reading my homepage would notice my
statement (that I do not take external students), I got a response
like this:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
it's fine if u donot want to work with me ,but such words don't 
suit a proff of ur standards
</div>
<p>Clearly there is no dearth of entitlement, just good sense.</p>

<p>Another rather colorful one:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
So are you or are you not going to offer me that internship ? I take
it from your silence that you haven't yet decided.  But you gotta
hurry up professor, you can't leave me hanging for weeks.
<br/><br/>
ps: I understand. That little blurb on your webpage is just to keep
down the number of applicants.
<br/><br/>
Heighly honourable esteemable Sirji,
<br/>
I, RRRR MMMM CCCC , son of Shri LLLL PPPP CCCC, am 3rd year student of
information technology at BBBB BBBB AAAA University in

</div>

<p>2007/11/26: 
Then there are those zero-knowledge requests that are careful not
to divulge to me my research area:
<div class="excerpt">
I have gone through the details of your research work
and the courses you are teaching and I am very keen to work in the
field of <span class="emph">............</span>
To enhance my knowledge and experience in this field, 
I would like to work under your esteemed guidance for my summer
internship.
</div>
That <span class="emph">............</span> sure looks like the Morse
code for an SOS!  Gone are the days when you had to waste your life
actually studying and liking some specific area and only <em>then</em>
write to people you wanted to work with.</p>

<p>Update on 2008/03/03: Here is <a href="response2.html">an
email from a student discussing</a>, for want of a more suitable word,
my policy.</p>

<p>2008/07/27: Here is another SMS-style &quot;application&quot;.
So happy to find approval!</p> 
<div class="excerpt">

</div>

<p>2008/07/31: And then there are people who get my affiliation wrong,
but the email right (formatting original):</p>

<div class="excerpt">

</div>

<p>2008/09/04: And now, project requests from the southern
hemisphere!</p>
<div class="excerpt">
Respected Professor,<br/>
We are students of III year B. Tech Computer Science And Engineering studying in NNNN, TTTT . We are interested in doing  a Technical Project under your able guidance during the <b>summer vacations</b> starting from <b>December-2008</b> for duration of 5-6 weeks.<br/>
We have gone through research papers in the fields of Development of Algorithms, Windows Develpment and Artificial Intelligence and have developed immense interest in the recent research and intricate details of the mentioned fields.
</div>

<p>2014/04/16: I cannot keep up with students and change my work area
as fast as they want me to.
<div class="excerpt">
At 01:09 AM:<br/>
I have gone through the Department profile and the research works you
have been associated with which has enhanced my interest in your area
of research in the field of <u>Parallel and Distributed Processing ,
Neural Nets and Architecture </u>and I assure you that with my utmost
sincerity &amp; hard work, I would be able to add value to any project I
am associated with.
</div>
And then
<div class="excerpt">
At 01:10 AM:<br/>
I have gone through the Department profile and the research works you

</div>
</p>

<p>Forget about the shoddy language, downright dishonesty and abject
desperation; these folks can't even read the homepages of people with
whom they ostensibly wish to work!  This is what I say very early in
my homepage, you can't miss it:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
At the moment I am <strong>not offering short-term projects</strong> to
students not enrolled in a regular program at IIT Bombay.  Only if you are
looking for at least a year-long position, send email with an ASCII
resume.</div>

<!-- p>It's hard to overstress the liability of a nation of a billion
people out of which 700 million are functionally illiterate and the
rest have no wish to follow instructions, even when they are asking
for a favor.</p -->

<p>And then there are people so offended with the above examples that they
send me hate mail:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="response3.html">Your webpage is the 
most depressing one ever !!!</a></li>
<li><a href="response4.html">Please keep your smart ass 
comments about Indians to yourself.</a></li>
