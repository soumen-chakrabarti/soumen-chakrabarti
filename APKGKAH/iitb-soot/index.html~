<h1>Where there's smoke there's soot</h1>

<p>I have written about the <a href="../iitb-burn/">burn-fest around
IIT</a> elsewhere.</p>

<p>Where do you think all that smoke goes?  To the lungs of animals
and people, for sure, but apart from escalating asthma and respiratory
distress, they show no other visible signs.</p>

<p>We clean our fiber-glass window screens every few weeks.  One wipe
deposits a handful of black gunk on the dustcloth.</p>

<p>Here is an air filter from my
office PC only two weeks after installation.  It was powder-white
when it was installed.</p>

<p>Most computers in IIT die because the fan chokes up with soot and
stops turning, which overheats the works.  Or the soot (which is
largely carbon and a good conductor) bridges tracks on PCBs and
connectors.  If you insert a new PCI card into your four-year-old
motherboard (how uncool!), the chances of a poor contact and
malfunction are about even.  Thanks to the sacrifices of many air
filters like the one above, my PC has been running since 1999, when I
joined IIT.</p>

<p>My home computer has a great Antec cabinet with a built-in air
filter, which I have reinforced with one more layer given our ambience.
Here is the filter opened out only three weeks after a thorough
soap-water clean.</p>

<p>A few more shots are shown with different lighting conditions to
highlight the volume of soot and grime on the filters.</p>
