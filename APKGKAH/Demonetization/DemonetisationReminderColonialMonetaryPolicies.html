<p>The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes has dominated
 Indian lives since its announcement on November 8, 2016. Its 
shock-and-awe approach has created a sense of <em>frisson</em> amongst 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s acolytes. However, for many who owe no 
allegiance to specific political dispensations, it has not been possible
 to accept the stated objectives at face value. The case for robust 
skepticism towards demonetisation as a means of tackling the scourge of 
black money has been effectively made by many writers and economists. 
But more than the views of the critics, it is the government’s 
constantly shifting goalposts that makes us discount the putative 
justification for such a drastic policy decision.</p>
<p>In the early weeks, the absence of a clear understanding on the true 
motive of such a radical monetary measure has led to much speculation 
that was akin to Kremlin watching during the Cold War era. Some have 
plausibly seen sudden demonetisation as an attempt to distract people 
from the <a target="_blank" href="https://thewire.in/82295/sahara-birla-diaries-prashant-bhushan/">Sahara-Birla bribery scandal</a>.
 Others have convincingly argued that this was an attempt to 
re-capitalise banks burdened with what are euphemistically called 
non-performing assets, meaning extract money from the hands of 
hard-working and honest citizens to paper over the fact that banks are 
in trouble thanks to the brazen behaviour of the ‘respectable’ captains 
of Indian industry. Amidst all the chest-thumping of going after the 
guilty, let us not forget that many top business houses that owe public 
sector banks obscene amounts of money remain untouched.</p>
<p>The demonetisation exercise has also been given the colour of a moral
 project in which ordinary citizens participate and endure suffering for
 a greater public good, a <em>yagna</em> for the eradication of black money from our lives. In his public utterances, Modi has himself repeatedly <a target="_blank" href="https://thewire.in/90856/pm-narendra-modi-addresses-nation-highlights/">appealed for cooperation in moral terms</a>.
 Given the powerful emotional charge of such an argument, it is 
important to subject it to an examination. The most significant example 
of a moral dimension to public and political causes is the Indian 
freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. But, in the light of our 
historical understanding, demonetisation fails two elementary tests we 
may apply to distinguish between morality and moralism. In the first 
instance, Gandhi did not merely demand sacrifices from others but 
willingly and demonstrably paid the price himself. Second, and more 
importantly, the principal thrust of Gandhi’s moral demand arose from an
 appeal to individual conscience. It was never backed by the might of a 
powerful organisation or the awesome powers of a coercive state. It is 
in this sense that the rhetoric of demonetisation as a moral project 
sounds rather contrived. No policy that peremptorily dragoons the entire
 population for dubious ends can stake a claim to the high ground of a 
moral exercise. Nevertheless, while we may discount the claims of moral 
virtue, Modi’s demonetisation has served as an important reminder. If 
modern states are defined by their monopoly over violence, it is equally
 so with their monopoly over money. Indeed, with the instantaneous 
extinguishing of the value of 86% of currency notes in circulation, Modi
 has put the ‘fiat’ back in fiat money.</p>
<p><strong>Colonial precedents</strong></p>
<p>Some commentators have drawn comparisons with historical precedents 
of demonetisation, including one instance during the tenure of Morarji 
Desai as prime minister. However, it is more fruitful to move away from 
the technical similarity with demonetisation and look at other instances
 where the monetary decisions of the rulers are ripe with moral hazard. 
After all, while most of us are largely insulated from the impact of the
 current cash drought, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwietPK4tqjRAhWHo48KHeqjAKgQFggjMAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewire.in%2F90145%2Fdalits-adivasis-demonetisation-bundelkhand%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFn-r3zj4peBMr5WaBkghCPHymu4g&amp;sig2=g9sD1_vhQckLCGhiIJb4Yg&amp;bvm=bv.142059868,d.c2I">rural poor</a> and the vast multitude who eke out a living in the so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuuIqptqjRAhVEKY8KHR7RBg0QFgghMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewire.in%2F80564%2Fmodis-demonetisation-move-may-have-permanently-damaged-indias-informal-sector%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRICeRkiWQ4qlodyJ5AVPJW6c-kA&amp;sig2=i2Ncgf6gPmyH6OmoU12Mqw">informal sector</a> have no such luxury.</p>
<p>Two such instances of invidious monetary policy occurred towards the 
end of British rule in India, during the Great Depression and later 
during the Second World War. While the trigger for the Great Depression 
was a financial crisis in the US in 1929, in about a year the effects of
 economic depression had enveloped the globe. Accompanied by global 
overproduction of food grains, the depression led to a crash of 
agricultural prices in India causing grave hardship. Indeed, the 
enthusiastic participation of Indian peasantry in the civil disobedience
 movement of this period was no coincidence.</p>
<p>The most important monetary policy measure of the time was the 
exchange ratio between the Indian rupee and the pound sterling. Britain 
had held the Indian rupee at an artificially high level which was 
financially beneficial for it in multiple ways. So effective was the 
sterling-rupee ratio in the economic exploitation of India that even in 
the face of India’s dire economic distress, the colonial regime 
resolutely stuck to it and refused to even countenance a devaluation of 
the Indian rupee. As painstakingly detailed by the distinguished 
economic historian Dietmar Rothermund in <em>India in the Great Depression: 1929-1939</em>,
 the crisis led to distress sale of gold by poor Indians. The result was
 the export of large volumes of the precious metal out of India that 
helped rebuild Britain’s gold reserves. Traditionally, bits of gold 
jewellery were the only modicum of security that a peasant had and the 
fact that he parted with it was clearly indicative of widespread and 
serious economic distress. Indeed, in Rothermund’s scholarly and 
measured assessment, the British opportunism in capturing distress gold 
for its own uses, thereby prolonging India’s economic depression, was “a
 case of criminal negligence”.</p>
<p>For the British, maintaining the sterling-rupee ratio was a 
self-serving article of faith. Amongst the many measures it undertook to
 protect its economic interests was the creation of an institution much 
in the news today, the Reserve Bank of India. Although conceived in 
theory as an independent bank, as the historian Aditya Mukherjee has 
shown, Britain stubbornly worked to insulate the RBI from the pressures 
of Indian public opinion and used the bank towards its own ends. These 
undemocratic measures paid rich dividends during the crisis period of 
the Second World War. During the war, a pliant RBI faithfully carried 
out its masters’ orders and printed enormous volumes of Indian currency 
that was used to buy up Indian goods to serve Britain’s war interests. 
To cut a long story short, this led to rampant inflation and an acute 
scarcity of food, cloth and other commodities. The resultant hardship 
inflicted on India in this period also included the devastating Bengal 
famine of 1943. In other words, if in 2016 the RBI has haplessly 
abdicated its responsibilities towards Indian people, it has much 
institutional precedent that is rooted in its very genesis.</p>
<p><strong>Revisiting Gandhi</strong></p>
<p>During the 1930s and 40s, many in Indian public life were enamoured 
of&nbsp;the possibility of using state power towards public welfare. The
 Gandhians also recognised that the state wielded enormous powers that 
should be harnessed towards noble ends. But in the ultimate analysis 
they remained skeptical enough to not believe that all the political and
 economic goals of society can and should be achieved through the 
instruments of the state. Therefore, while demanding accountability from
 the political state, Gandhi and his co-workers consistently pushed for a
 decentralised political and economic order. This was seen as a measure 
against the capture of the edifice of the state by the powerful. It was 
also necessary as a means to ensure the economic autonomy of the poor 
who had no resources other than their own labour. Indeed, the economic 
philosopher and constructive worker J.C. Kumarappa had the abuse of 
concentrated power in mind when he argued that “centralization in 
industries is inimical to the development of democracy in politics”. He 
could have as well made the same case against the centralised monopoly 
over money that is a fundamental characteristic of the modern political 
state.</p>
<p>In the face of the refusal of the colonial powers to address the 
grave problems of its subjects, the Gandhians did not limit themselves 
to criticism. One interesting experiment was the development of a 
small-scale bartering system by Tanguturi Prakasam and his colleagues in
 the coastal Andhra region during the 1930s. In their stores, people 
could exchange hand-spun hank yarn for tokens. In turn, these tokens 
could be used to purchase <em>khadi</em> cloth, food and other 
commodities in the same stores. Thereby the attempt was to provide fair 
value to those who had worked to spin the yarn that was central to 
Gandhi’s khadi movement. While this arrangement had a limited impact in a
 small community, in principle it was an attempt to counter the truism 
that ‘for transfer of purchasing power, money and credit are 
unsurpassed’. In early 1942, in the face of severe economic distress of 
the people nnd a brutal and unyielding ruling dispensation, Gandhi 
himself advocated the development of a yarn currency. As an experiment, 
Gandhi suggested that the vast network of khadi stores use “a warp 
length of a single thread of yarn as the lowest measure” of a token of 
exchange. Gandhi recognised that this was a rather limited move and 
argued that khadi workers should investigate it further and analyse its 
possible merits and flaws. Soon India entered the political 
conflagration of Quit India and the idea of yarn currency was 
still-born. Gandhi and many others were imprisoned and a ruthless Raj 
deliberately crushed not only the political Congress but the khadi 
network as well. Nevertheless, in the face of a serious cloth famine in 
India at the time and with the rupee utterly debased by rampant 
inflation, and all-round scarcity, yarn currency was an interesting idea
 that could have helped bootstrap some people into economic activity.</p>
<p>Throughout his public life, Gandhi remained skeptical of the ability 
of the modern state to deliver justice in its truest sense. Nor was he 
enamoured of what would qualify today as ‘free market’ solutions. Here 
we should recognise that Gandhi and his colleagues were not anarchists 
opposed to the very idea of a state. Rather, they had a realistic 
assessment that the capacity of the state to do good could be equally 
deployed to do harm to its own citizens. Their solution was to build 
resilience against abuse into the political and economic order by the 
decentralisation of power. We should also recognise that the Gandhians 
were not naive about either the desirability or the feasibility of a 
full-blown barter system in the modern era. Nevertheless, theirs was an 
attempt to capture the spirit of equity inherent to a barter economy and
 deploy it to contemporary ends.</p>
<p>In recent years, India and many other nations have been subjected to 
the dictates of powerful financial interests from abroad and equally 
nefarious home-grown crony capitalists. Modi’s demonetisation can be 
seen as just the latest of a slew of measures which are inimical to 
public welfare. At the same time, most of the political parties that 
currently form the opposition have hardly distinguished themselves as 
protectors of people’s interests when in power. But the fundamental 
issues at stake are too important to be left to the <em>akhada</em> of 
electoral politics alone. If anything, demonetisation should give us 
pause to rethink fundamental principles. In this endeavour, Gandhi and 
his colleagues hold important lessons for those willing to listen and 
learn.</p>

Its shock-and-awe approach has created a sense of \u003Cem\u003Efrisson\u003C\u002Fem\u003E amongst Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s acolytes. However, for many who owe no allegiance to specific political dispensations, it has not been possible to accept the stated objectives at face value. The case for robust skepticism towards demonetisation as a means of tackling the scourge of black money has been effectively made by many writers and economists. But more than the views of the critics, it is the government&#8217;s constantly shifting goalposts that makes us discount the putative justification for such a drastic policy decision.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the early weeks, the absence of a clear understanding on the true motive of such a radical monetary measure has led to much speculation that was akin to Kremlin watching during the Cold War era. Some have plausibly seen sudden demonetisation as an attempt to distract people from the \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fthewire.in\u002F82295\u002Fsahara-birla-diaries-prashant-bhushan\u002F\"\u003ESahara-Birla bribery scandal\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Others have convincingly argued that this was an attempt to re-capitalise banks burdened with what are euphemistically called non-performing assets, meaning extract money from the hands of hard-working and honest citizens to paper over the fact that banks are in trouble thanks to the brazen behaviour of the &#8216;respectable&#8217; captains of Indian industry. Amidst all the chest-thumping of going after the guilty, let us not forget that many top business houses that owe public sector banks obscene amounts of money remain untouched.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe demonetisation exercise has also been given the colour of a moral project in which ordinary citizens participate and endure suffering for a greater public good, a \u003Cem\u003Eyagna\u003C\u002Fem\u003E for the eradication of black money from our lives. In his public utterances, Modi has himself repeatedly \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fthewire.in\u002F90856\u002Fpm-narendra-modi-addresses-nation-highlights\u002F\"\u003Eappealed for cooperation in moral terms\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Given the powerful emotional charge of such an argument, it is important to subject it to an examination. The most significant example of a moral dimension to public and political causes is the Indian freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. But, in the light of our historical understanding, demonetisation fails two elementary tests we may apply to distinguish between morality and moralism. In the first instance, Gandhi did not merely demand sacrifices from others but willingly and demonstrably paid the price himself. Second, and more importantly, the principal thrust of Gandhi&#8217;s moral demand arose from an appeal to individual conscience. It was never backed by the might of a powerful organisation or the awesome powers of a coercive state. It is in this sense that the rhetoric of demonetisation as a moral project sounds rather contrived. No policy that peremptorily dragoons the entire population for dubious ends can stake a claim to the high ground of a moral exercise. Nevertheless, while we may discount the claims of moral virtue, Modi&#8217;s demonetisation has served as an important reminder. If modern states are defined by their monopoly over violence, it is equally so with their monopoly over money. Indeed, with the instantaneous extinguishing of the value of 86% of currency notes in circulation, Modi has put the &#8216;fiat&#8217; back in fiat money.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EColonial precedents\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome commentators have drawn comparisons with historical precedents of demonetisation, including one instance during the tenure of Morarji Desai as prime minister. However, it is more fruitful to move away from the technical similarity with demonetisation and look at other instances where the monetary decisions of the rulers are ripe with moral hazard.

While the trigger for the Great Depression was a financial crisis in the US in 1929, in about a year the effects of economic depression had enveloped the globe. Accompanied by global overproduction of food grains, the depression led to a crash of agricultural prices in India causing grave hardship. Indeed, the enthusiastic participation of Indian peasantry in the civil disobedience movement of this period was no coincidence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most important monetary policy measure of the time was the exchange ratio between the Indian rupee and the pound sterling. Britain had held the Indian rupee at an artificially high level which was financially beneficial for it in multiple ways. So effective was the sterling-rupee ratio in the economic exploitation of India that even in the face of India&#8217;s dire economic distress, the colonial regime resolutely stuck to it and refused to even countenance a devaluation of the Indian rupee. As painstakingly detailed by the distinguished economic historian Dietmar Rothermund in \u003Cem\u003EIndia in the Great Depression: 1929-1939\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, the crisis led to distress sale of gold by poor Indians. The result was the export of large volumes of the precious metal out of India that helped rebuild Britain&#8217;s gold reserves. Traditionally, bits of gold jewellery were the only modicum of security that a peasant had and the fact that he parted with it was clearly indicative of widespread and serious economic distress. Indeed, in Rothermund&#8217;s scholarly and measured assessment, the British opportunism in capturing distress gold for its own uses, thereby prolonging India&#8217;s economic depression, was &#8220;a case of criminal negligence&#8221;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the British, maintaining the sterling-rupee ratio was a self-serving article of faith. Amongst the many measures it undertook to protect its economic interests was the creation of an institution much in the news today, the Reserve Bank of India. Although conceived in theory as an independent bank, as the historian Aditya Mukherjee has shown, Britain stubbornly worked to insulate the RBI from the pressures of Indian public opinion and used the bank towards its own ends. These undemocratic measures paid rich dividends during the crisis period of the Second World War. During the war, a pliant RBI faithfully carried out its masters&#8217; orders and printed enormous volumes of Indian currency that was used to buy up Indian goods to serve Britain&#8217;s war interests. To cut a long story short, this led to rampant inflation and an acute scarcity of food, cloth and other commodities. The resultant hardship inflicted on India in this period also included the devastating Bengal famine of 1943. In other words, if in 2016 the RBI has haplessly abdicated its responsibilities towards Indian people, it has much institutional precedent that is rooted in its very genesis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERevisiting Gandhi\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the 1930s and 40s, many in Indian public life were enamoured of the possibility of using state power towards public welfare. The Gandhians also recognised that the state wielded enormous powers that should be harnessed towards noble ends. But in the ultimate analysis they remained skeptical enough to not believe that all the political and economic goals of society can and should be achieved through the instruments of the state. Therefore, while demanding accountability from the political state, Gandhi and his co-workers consistently pushed for a decentralised political and economic order. This was seen as a measure against the capture of the edifice of the state by the powerful. It was also necessary as a means to ensure the economic autonomy of the poor who had no resources other than their own labour. Indeed, the economic philosopher and constructive worker J.C. Kumarappa had the abuse of concentrated power in mind when he argued that &#8220;centralization in industries is inimical to the development of democracy in politics&#8221;. He could have as well made the same case against the centralised monopoly over money that is a fundamental characteristic of the modern political state.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the face of the refusal of the colonial powers to address the grave problems of its subjects, the Gandhians did not limit themselves to criticism. One interesting experiment was the development of a small-scale bartering system by Tanguturi Prakasam and his colleagues in the coastal Andhra region during the 1930s. In their stores, people could exchange hand-spun hank yarn for tokens. In turn, these tokens could be used to purchase \u003Cem\u003Ekhadi\u003C\u002Fem\u003E cloth, food and other commodities in the same stores. Thereby the attempt was to provide fair value to those who had worked to spin the yarn that was central to Gandhi&#8217;s khadi movement. While this arrangement had a limited impact in a small community, in principle it was an attempt to counter the truism that &#8216;for transfer of purchasing power, money and credit are unsurpassed&#8217;. In early 1942, in the face of severe economic distress of the people nnd a brutal and unyielding ruling dispensation, Gandhi himself advocated the development of a yarn currency. As an experiment, Gandhi suggested that the vast network of khadi stores use &#8220;a warp length of a single thread of yarn as the lowest measure&#8221; of a token of exchange. Gandhi recognised that this was a rather limited move and argued that khadi workers should investigate it further and analyse its possible merits and flaws. Soon India entered the political conflagration of Quit India and the idea of yarn currency was still-born. Gandhi and many others were imprisoned and a ruthless Raj deliberately crushed not only the political Congress but the khadi network as well. Nevertheless, in the face of a serious cloth famine in India at the time and with the rupee utterly debased by rampant inflation, and all-round scarcity, yarn currency was an interesting idea that could have helped bootstrap some people into economic activity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout his public life, Gandhi remained skeptical of the ability of the modern state to deliver justice in its truest sense.
