<h1>Demand Destruction via Attention Deficit</h1>

<p>This is a more serious posting, no photo essay here.</p>

<p>Nations with a colonized past, like India, have depended on
export-oriented economies up until the turn of the century.  After a
decade of liberalization, the Indian middle-class is well on its way
to self-reliance in terms of consumption; we are unwilling to keep
producing and accept favors from the consumer of last resort: the
American middle class.</p>

<p>The implications of this self-reliance is certainly not lost on
Americans or Europeans; they spend sleepless nights worrying about the
state of energy, material resources and the environment if two billion
people in China and India aspire to live middle-class American or
European lives within a generation or two.  In short, we will run out
of planet.</p>
