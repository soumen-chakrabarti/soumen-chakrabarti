Relax; no terrorist can match the soup we have created with the help of kind, tolerant, and infinitely fecund non-terrorists.  Stampedes in temples, people dropping off local trains, annual Antarjali-jatra in the Gangetic plains and coasts, adulterated food and kidney stones and colon cancers, poisoning people by burning naptha in autos; just do the darn numbers.  Any engineer worth his/her degree will discount terrorism as not being remotely near the critical path.
