<h1>Demand Destruction via Attention Deficit</h1>

<p>This is a more serious posting, no photo essay here.</p>

<p>Nations with a colonized past, like India, have depended on
export-oriented economies up until the turn of the century.  After a
decade of liberalization, the Indian middle-class is well on its way
to self-reliance in terms of consumption; we are unwilling to keep
producing and accept favors from the consumer of last resort: the
American middle class.</p>

<p>The implications of this self-reliance is certainly not lost on
Americans or Europeans; they spend sleepless nights worrying about the
state of energy, material resources and the environment if two billion
people in China and India aspire to live middle-class American or
European lives within a generation or two.  The short summary is that
we will run out of planet.</p>

<p>The will of billions of people, no matter how clueless, to live
semi-decent lives, is not easy to overthrow.  However, some military
and monetary approaches are being devised over the last decade, to
compensate for the intractability of political approaches to curbing
Asian consumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab resources by force, so that money becomes irrelevant.</li>
<li>Use international monetary force (IMF!) to remove regional 
political protection from domestic (Indian) currency, so that there 
are small, if any, conversion barriers.</li>
<li>Print enormous quantities of &quot;hard&quot; currency without
the backing of physical resources, and use this debased currency to
pay for goods and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>But this is not the usual left-wing political invective against the
above forces.  This is about unintended pathways of consequences of
such actions.</p>
