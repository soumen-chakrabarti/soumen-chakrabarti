And how did MV presume to occupy the high chair from which he dispenses the right to criticize? No one vested in him this authority. We always have the right to criticize, and we never had, or will have, the right to be heard. While working harder, procreating less, educating more, paying more taxes, and being more socially responsible than any other class, we have been milked dry by the ever growing bottom of the pyramid, and the ever more powerful top of the pyramid. No government will protect the value of the rupee. No government will reward savers who live within their means. No government will reward merit and uphold the rule of law, even if it hurts them. No government will dare limit the powers of land developers or sanitize real estate prices. No government will adopt a selfless half-century horizon to primary education. We eat, drink and breathe poison. Even Vietnam rejects our medicines. Leeches who spend most of their waking hours scheming to milk public good into private wealth, like politicians, film stars or sports people, suddenly become patriotic and exhort us to vote. Sivsena quotes that in ancient Greece, non-voters were called "idiots". Voting in a failed, meaningless democracy has reached the status of a fetish! The game is up. It is time to put an end to this charade of a democracy that is the laughing stock of the civilized world. Not voting is very cool.
