<h1>Holy Indignation about Hate Crime in Australia</h1>

<p>Make a list of the grandmasters of colonial empires: Spain,
Portugal, England, and the "also ran" losers France and Belgium.  Ever
since Vasco da Gama and Colombus, up through chronicled accounts of
the English in India, the foot soldiers of all colonial powers were
characterized by one single unifying characteristic: They all
believed, with a striking childlike innocence, that the colonies were
theirs to occupy, enjoy and exploit, that the forests, minerals, corn
fields, and even human labor were already ordained as their
property. They were merely acquiring what was already rightfully
theirs, and the "natives" or aborigines were so much pestilence
blocking their rightful access.</p>

<p>A few hundred years later, the tables have turned, and how!
Emigration is now a standard narrative for middle-class Indians.  The
Right to Emigrate is granted to us via divine fiat, with pesky visa
officers and xenophobic rednecks that must be trampled over in our
Holy March spanning Anchorage to Auckland.  The fruits of their social
organization, civic discipline, superior infrastructure, are already
ours for the taking.  Who are they to decide that they need only a few
computer programmers and not a few thousand cab drivers?  After all,
their average age is 45+, ours is 20--25; the needs of the many young
must trump the wants of the wizened few.  Just like the Caucasians
that taught us Colonization and Empire, our childlike innocence never
fails to amaze.</p>

<p>There are several ways to interpret and rationalize the Indian
indignation going around Australia and the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sense of entitlement is human nature. Same DNA, different
century. Too bad the joke's on them now.</li>

<li>They owe it to us. Their prosperity was based directly or
indirectly on colonialism. It's payback time.</li>

<li>They set up their immigration system for their benefit. They
cannot let us in and then mistreat us.</li>

<li>You mean we learnt to like jeans and coke all in vain? Oh no, we
have been betrayed again!</li>

<li>It's going to take more than a few jet-propelled screwdrivers to
beat the hellhole that is life in India.</li>

</ul>
