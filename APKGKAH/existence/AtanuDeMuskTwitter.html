"Non sequitur" means "it does not follow".  My comment about Elon Musk and Twitter was not intended to follow any of your pronouncements, or those of Ayn Rand.  It was meant to offer an argument that Musk'd respect for his money may not be all that folks may be led to believe by reading Ayn Rand.

Before we get further into your post on "Twitter and Musk", let me point out that within hours of my "non sequitur", Musk is now embroiled in various "sampling algorithms" (of dubious efficacy, as pointed out by experts on social media analytics, but of course much poorer than Elon Musk) to assess what percent of Twitter is an illusion, probably to bargain down the price he offered and is now probably regretting.  But that's conjecture.

Let's get to your post on "Twitter and Musk".  "It’s his money. He earned it. He gets to do whatever he wants to do with his money."  Of course.  Where did you find any censure in my comment on what he should or should not do with his money?  Likewise, negligible as everyone is compared to The Musk, everyone can form and express their opinion about the value of the Twitter takeover, and you are free to censor your blog as you wish.  Adults never say "you cannot say that" to other adults.  They take other measures.  But perhaps woke America is all about muzzling free speech, and despite your Ayn Rand leanings, woke America is getting to you.  Beware my friend.

In the next few paras you extol, unnecessarily forcefully, even desperately, one might say, the virtue of entrepreneurs.  It's beyond defensive.  Why?  In spite of living in USA, are you surrounded by socialists (or worse, communists) who think money is evil and private enterprise is just ugly greed and state power is the only legitimate power?  That sounds like a terrible living arrangment in the sunset years of any -ism worth remembering!  I wish and hope you are surrounded by people that challenge you intellectually and logically, and not live the Bill Maher style soundtrack wah-wah lifestyle.

Your language smacks of putdowns on the non-entrepreneurs.  You basically spell out that they should keep their trap shut and never assess the entrepreneur mandarins of society: "We, who are not entrepreneurs, are mere cogs in the great big machine built by entrepreneurs that manufactures wealth. Cogs are not unimportant but they are not irreplaceable; entrepreneurs are uniquely useful.  We are the beneficiaries and the entrepreneurs are our benefactors."  For someone brought up at Berkeley, this is disappointing.  How can you ever innovate within your own sphere, with this level of conformal thinking?

"Wouldn’t it have been better if Musk had spent his $46.5 billion to alleviate hunger instead of frivolously buying Twitter for his own amusement?" — Good heavens!  Where in my earlier comment was any hint that Musk should have alleviated hunger or done a single dollar of charity?  Either you are setting up a straw man, or you are really sorrounded or hounded by communists.

"Twitter is [...] useful enough that Musk valued it at $46.5 billion" — and that, in your opinion is sequitur whereas what I said (to disprove every line of the Ayn Rand excerpt) is non sequitur?  Twitter is so-and-so valuable because Musk said so?  If every pronouncement were weighted by the bank balance of the speaker, would the resulting worldview allow the fantastic innovations that make these speakers super-rich?

"Successful investors like Musk are not stupid" — you are not doing poorly at non sequiturs either!  Where did I say Musk is stupid?  Remember, the context was respect for money.  Again, where is your intense defensiveness coming from?

"Feeding the hungry is a very noble enterprise. But that’s not the entrepreneur’s responsibility."  I agree with the second sentence but not the first.  I see no nobility in feeding the hungry.  That is not how capitalism (or even democracy) works.  Feeding the hungry is not even the responsibility of the government.  Actually, given the last three years, it is becoming unclear if governments have any responsibility at all.

"I am seriously tempted to delete pointless comments from oh-so-clever handles." — Thanks for the compliment on the handle, and clearly my comment ignited some hidden feelings inside you and elicited quite a bit about your understanding of the complex world around us, so it was hardly pointless.
